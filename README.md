# Failure-Theories-and-Fatigue-Life
#### Using For Distortion Energy (von Mises) failure theory and modified Goodman fatigue line as necessary, the goal for this project was to:
  * Use a static analysis to find the minimum diameter so that the worst case static safety factor based on material yielding is 1.05.
  * Assuming that the number of cycles at each load level is equal, to estimate the number of cycles to failure.
